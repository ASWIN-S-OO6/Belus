Belus Launcher - Parental Control Application
Belus Launcher is an advanced parental control application designed to monitor and protect children from inappropriate content on their devices. By integrating Google Cloud Vision API, it performs real-time image and text analysis, detects unsafe content, and takes immediate action by closing the application and sending an SMS alert to parents.
